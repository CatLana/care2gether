  <section class="section">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Our communities are losing natural spaces due to pollution, neglect, and lack of coordinated action.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Loss of green areas</li>
      <li>Damage to local ecosystems</li>
      <li>Decreased biodiversity</li>
      <li>Unsafe, neglected public spaces</li>
    </ul>
    <p>People want to help, but most don’t know where to start.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>The Gap</h2>
    <p>There is no simple, community-driven platform that helps people:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Join environmental cleanups and restoration events</li>
      <li>Learn about local environmental issues</li>
      <li>Make consistent, meaningful impact</li>
      <li>Connect with like‑minded volunteers</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>The Solution: Care2gether</h2>
    <p>Care2gether brings volunteers, neighbours, and organisers together to restore and protect natural spaces—one community at a time.</p>
    <p>It empowers people not only to act, but to learn, connect, and lead change.</p>
